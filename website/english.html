        The Taj Mahal was constructed in 1632 by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of
        his wife Mumtaz Mahal,died giving birth to her 14th child near Burhanpur
        in Madhya Pradesh where she had been accompanying Shah Jahan on one of
        his military campaigns she died at the age of 39, had been initially
        named 'Roza-e-Munavvara' which means Unique Building, but was then
        renamed by Shah Jahan as Taj Mahal as a loving tribute to his wife for
        whom his love surpassed all belief.Shah Jahan was so distraught upon
        Mumtaz's death that he confined himself in a room for a week and when he
        came out of the room, all his hair had turned grey. Mumtaz's body was
        interred temporarily in Burhanpur itself and was later on transferred to
        the Taj Mahal's central hall. Historians also believe Taj Mahal belonged
        to Raja Jai Singh and there was an orchard on this land, which was
        removed to build the Taj Mahal. Jai Singh was compensated for the land
        in the form of 5 'Havelis' as the tomb for Mumtaz Mahal could not be
        constructed on donated land according to Islamic tenets.

        The Taj had been designed by Ustad Ahmad Lahori and Ustad Abdul Karim,
        which was approved by Shah Jahan. The Taj took over two decades to be
        constructed and there were artisans called from as far as Armenia,
        Italy, France, and Turkey working on the monument. Over 39 types of
        semi-precious stones were used in this monument along with 4000-kg of
        gold. The architectural principles that Taj Mahal encapsulates include
        are Rational and strict geometry, Perfect symmetrical planning,
        Hierarchical grading of materials, forms and colours Triadic divisions
        bound together in proportional formulas, Uniformity of shapes, Sensuous
        attention to detail Selective use of naturalism Symbolism. Consequently,
        by the time Taj Mahal was constructed, the empire was in serious trouble
        due to lack of funds. With the Marathas and the Rajputs encroaching into
        the empire's boundaries and Shah Jahan lost in his own reveries, his son
        Muhi-ud-Din Mohammad, took charge of the empire's armies and suppressed
        the rebellions, later on returning to Agra to imprison his own father
        and murder his brothers to name himself as the sixth Mughal emperor
        Aurangzeb. Shah Jahan's last days were spent confined in his room in the
        Agra Fort, gazing from across the Yamuna at the Taj Mahal.

          It was a time period of 1632-1653 when Taj Mahal was built. Shah Jahan
          spent nearly 32 million rupees on the construction of what we now
          recognize as the epitome of love. Wondering what would be the value of
          money at present? Well, today the amount would be close to $1 Billion.
        </li>
        <li>
          If observed carefully, the four pillars or minarets are tilted
          outwards rather than standing straight. The reason why it was
          constructed in such a way was to protect the main tomb (gumbad) from
          being damaged with the falling of minarets on it in case of any
          natural calamity like an earthquake.
        </li>
        <li>
          The story of arms of artisans being cut-off to make sure that no such
          monument was ever built again is a hoax as the same man- Ustad Ahmad
          Lahauri (a Persian from Iran) who was the supervisor of the architect
          team, laid the foundation of Red Fort too.

          The changing moods of the Emperors wife are well captured by the
          changing hues of the Mausoleum at different times of the day. It takes
          a pinkish hue in the morning, milky white in the evening and golden at
          night when illuminated by moonlight.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Taj Mahal is made of wood that requires moisture to be strong.If
          the Yamuna River did not run alongside the Taj Mahal, the wood would
          rot.
