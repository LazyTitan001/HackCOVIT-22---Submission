## ABOUT THE PROJECT: ##
This portal is a contribution to the community for the tourists who have no clue about the significance of the Indian heritage. It informs the users about the history and facts of different places which contribute to the heritage of India. The user is supposed to scan the bar code, which leads it to the homepage. One of the unique features of this website is that the user has the liberty to choose their preferred language. In this way, there is no need of hiring a guide. Therefore, the whole process of traveling is eased without the whole in your pocket.

## MOTIVATION: ##
Our heritage is our identity. With the increase in modernization, we are departing from our roots. These days people are so busy clicking aesthetic snaps that they never think of how exactly that amazing piece of art was built or what was the thought behind it. Thus we created **UntoldCulture** for solving such issues and making people aware of the significance of Indian heritage.

## PRERQUISITES: ##
This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them. For this particular section, I will suppose that you already have Google Lens on your Mobile Device.

## WHAT WE LEARNED: ##
For two of our group members, this was our first-ever hackathon experience. We learned how to properly communicate with our team members in a short amount of time, how to share ideas and brainstorm with one another, and how to simultaneously work on code chunks together.

## STATUS: ##
-To take this portal to another level, we can add multiple heritage locations and also include cities with cultural significance.
